My name is Mark and I have spent the last 6 years working as a Research Scientist in Computational Biology. As much as I enjoyed this type of work, I needed a change. I will leave the reason for this change for another day....maybe a blog. After taking more than a year off from working to assist my parents in remodeling a couple of short term rental properties to supplement their income and spend time with the family, I look forward to what lies ahead.
